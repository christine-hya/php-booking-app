## PHP OOP Booking App for Backend Programming (CodeSpace)

The brief was to create a website that takes information from various hotels and allows users to make a comparison of rates based on the amount of days a user wishes to stay at those hotels. The website had to include the below requirements and I styled it using CSS only, no frameworks were used. 

Requirements:
* OOP programming
* A maintanable codebase
* Responsiveness
* Front-end validation
* A booking form
* A compare feature
* Persistent data
* An email with pre-populated data
